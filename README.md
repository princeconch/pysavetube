a simple wrapper for the PyTubeFix library which utilises FFMpeg and bash.

## how to use
to use:
1. clone the repository and cd into it
2. install requirements with 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (preferably using a venv)

currently it is possible to download both single videos and playlists.

### issues
